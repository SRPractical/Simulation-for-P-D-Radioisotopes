# Simulation-for-P-D-Radioisotopes
This is the project location of Sebastian Roe's P/D based graphical elution simulation.
To use, download the .xls file attached, and fill in the green highlighted boxes with the specifications of your generator and associated isotope.
Default data was used for comparative reasons, so that I could compare against departmental data, to see if optimisations could be made without additional risk incurred or redundant work.
